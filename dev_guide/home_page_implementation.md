✅ My Classes section with class cards and due dates
✅ Recent Documents section with horizontal scroll
✅ Proper spacing and padding throughout
✅ Color-coded UI elements matching the design
✅ Responsive layout with SingleChildScrollView

## Architecture Compliance

✅ **Feature-First**: All files organized under `features/home/`
✅ **UI Layer**: Pages and widgets properly separated
✅ **Component Structure**: Reusable widget components
✅ **AutoRoute**: Page annotated with `@RoutePage()`
✅ **Material Design**: Uses Theme-based styling

## Next Steps

To make the page functional with real data:

1. **Create Domain Entities** for:

   - Work items
   - Classes
   - Documents

2. **Create Data Layer**:

   - DTOs for API responses
   - Remote data sources
   - Repository implementations

3. **Create Service Layer**:

   - Service for fetching work items
   - Service for fetching classes
   - Service for fetching documents

4. **Create Controllers**:

   - AsyncNotifier for home data
   - Refresh functionality
   - Error handling

5. **Update Widgets** to use Riverpod and consume real data

## Running the App

After running `make build-runner`, the app should display the home page with the mock UI when you navigate to the home tab.

The page is fully functional as a static UI and ready to be enhanced with real data fetching logic.
